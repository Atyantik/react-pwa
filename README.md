#### Features
##### PWA  - Progressive Web Applications
Using ReactPWA you can create Progressive web application with simple knowledge of React.JS. As we all know, Progressive Apps are not supported everywhere, but we have added support for Safari & Chrome so your application can work as 
standalone applications when added to homescreen or saved as desktop app.

##### Code splitting
The very difficulty faced when developing enterprise application is code splitting. We don't need everything in a single JS file. Why not create individual JS files for each respective module/page!
We make it really easy here to just create a page that returns an array of routes. Code is split and loaded automatically when the respective route is called.
